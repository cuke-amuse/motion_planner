# GRANSAC: Multi-threaded generic RANSAC implemetation

This is a header-only, multi-threaded implementation of the [RANSAC algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RANSAC),
used widely in computer vision.

Unlike most other implementations, this is a **generic** implementation
which can be adopted for any problem. The user has to implement a class that
inherits the AbstractModel class. Using RANSAC afterwards should just work.

## Dependencies

This library uses *C++11* features, so a suitable compiler is required (GCC 4.7+, 
Visual Studio 2013+). Additionally, *OpenMP* is needed for multi-threading.

Optionally, to build the line fiting example, *OpenCV* and *CMake* are required.

## Usage

Just include the header GRANSAC.hpp in your application. The AbstractModel class
needs to be inherited to implement a suitable model for your application.

## Example: Line Fitting

To demonstrate how to use the library a line fitting example is included.
To build this example do the following:

```bash
$ pwd
<SOME_DIR>/GRANSAC
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ../examples/
$ make
$ ./LineFittingSample 1000 500
```

Running LineFittingSample should display a window with random 2D points around
the diagonal. Green points show inliers.
